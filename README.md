# Kubernetes Plugin for Steampipe

Use SQL to query Kubernetes components.

Apart from querying the deployed resources, the plugin also supports scanning the [Kubernetes manifest files](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/kubernetes#supported-manifest-file-path-formats) from different sources, parsing the configured [Helm charts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/kubernetes#helm-configuration) and scanning all the templates to get the list of Kubernetes resources.

## Quick start

### Install

Download and install the latest Kubernetes plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install kubernetes
```

Installing the latest Kubernetes plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/kubernetes.spc`) with a single connection named `kubernetes`:

```hcl
connection "kubernetes" {
  plugin = "kubernetes"

  # By default, the plugin will use credentials in "~/.kube/config" with the current context.
  # OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication is supported without any extra configuration.
  # The kubeconfig path and context can also be specified with the following config arguments:

  # Specify the file path to the kubeconfig.
  # Can also be set with the "KUBE_CONFIG_PATHS" or "KUBERNETES_MASTER" environment variables.
  # config_path = "~/.kube/config"

  # Specify a context other than the current one.
  # config_context = "minikube"

  # List of custom resources that will be created as dynamic tables.
  # No dynamic tables will be created if this arg is empty or not set.
  # Wildcard based searches are supported.

  # For example:
  #  - "*" matches all custom resources available
  #  - "*.storage.k8s.io" matches all custom resources in the storage.k8s.io group
  #  - "certificates.cert-manager.io" matches a specific custom resource "certificates.cert-manager.io"
  #  - "backendconfig" matches the singular name "backendconfig" in any group

  # Defaults to all custom resources
  custom_resource_tables = ["*"]

  # If no kubeconfig file can be found, the plugin will attempt to use the service account Kubernetes gives to pods.
  # This authentication method is intended for clients that expect to be running inside a pod running on Kubernetes.

  # Specify the source of the resource. Possible values: `deployed`, `helm`, `manifest`, and `all`.
  # Default set to `all`. Set the argument to override the default value.
  # If the value is set to `deployed`, tables will show all the deployed resources.
  # If set to `helm`, tables will only show resources from the configured helm charts.
  # If set to `manifest`, tables will show all the resources from the kubernetes manifest. Make sure that the `manifest_file_paths` arg is set.
  # If `all`, tables will show all the deployed and manifest resources.
  # source_type = "all"

  # Manifest File Configuration
  
  # Manifest file paths is a list of locations to search for Kubernetes manifest files
  # Manifest file paths can be configured with a local directory, a remote Git repository URL, or an S3 bucket URL
  # Refer https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/kubernetes#supported-path-formats for more information
  # Wildcard based searches are supported, including recursive searches
  # Local paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD)

  # For example:
  #  - "*.yml" or "*.yaml" or "*.json" matches all Kubernetes manifest files in the CWD
  #  - "**/*.yml" or "**/*.yaml" or "**/*.json" matches all Kubernetes manifest files in the CWD and all sub-directories
  #  - "../*.yml" or "../*.yaml" or "../*.json" matches all Kubernetes manifest files in the CWD's parent directory
  #  - "steampipe*.yml" or "steampipe*.yaml" or "steampipe*.json" matches all Kubernetes manifest files starting with "steampipe" in the CWD
  #  - "/path/to/dir/*.yml" or "/path/to/dir/*.yaml" or "/path/to/dir/*.json" matches all Kubernetes manifest files in a specific directory
  #  - "/path/to/dir/main.yml" or "/path/to/dir/main.yaml" or "/path/to/dir/main.json" matches a specific file

  # If the given paths includes "*", all files (including non-kubernetes manifest files) in
  # the CWD will be matched, which may cause errors if incompatible file types exist

  # Defaults to CWD
  # manifest_file_paths = [ "*.yml", "*.yaml", "*.json" ]

  # Helm configuration
  
  # A map for Helm charts along with the path to the chart directory and the paths of the value override files (if any).
  # Every map should have chart_path defined, and the values_file_paths is optional.
  # You can define multiple charts in the config.
  # helm_rendered_charts = {
  #   "chart_name" = {
  #     chart_path        = "/path/to/chart/dir"
  #     values_file_paths = ["/path/to/value/override/files.yaml"]
  #   }
  # }
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

List all pods:

```sql
select
  name,
  namespace,
  phase,
  creation_timestamp,
  pod_ip
from
  kubernetes_pod;
```

```sh
+-----------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+---------------------+-----------+

## Developing

Prerequisites:

- [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/downloads)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-kubernetes.git
cd steampipe-plugin-kubernetes
```

Build, which automatically installs the new version to your `~/.steampipe/plugins` directory:

```sh
make
```

Configure the plugin:

```shell
cp config/* ~/.steampipe/config
vi ~/.steampipe/config/kubernetes.spc
```

Try it!

```shell
steampipe query
> .inspect kubernetes
```
