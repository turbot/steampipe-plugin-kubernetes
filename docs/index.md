# Kubernetes + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

For example:

```sql
select
  name,
  namespace,
  phase,
  creation_timestamp,
  pod_ip
from
  kubernetes_pod;
```

```
+-----------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+---------------------+-----------+

## Documentation

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Kubernetes plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install kubernetes
```

### Configuration

Installing the latest kubernetes plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/kubernetes.spc`) with a single connection named `kubernetes`:

```hcl
connection "kubernetes" {
  plugin = "kubernetes"

  # By default, the plugin will use credentials in "~/.kube/config" with the current context.
  # OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication is supported without any extra configuration.
  # The kubeconfig path and context can also be specified with the following config arguments:

  # Specify the file path to the kubeconfig.
  # Can also be set with the "KUBE_CONFIG_PATHS" or "KUBERNETES_MASTER" environment variables.
  # config_path = "~/.kube/config"

  # Specify a context other than the current one.
  # config_context = "minikube"

  # List of custom resources that will be created as dynamic tables
  # No dynamic tables will be created if this arg is empty or not set
  # Wildcard based searches are supported

  # For example:
  #  - "*" matches all custom resources available
  #  - "*.storage.k8s.io" matches all custom resources in the storage.k8s.io group
  #  - "certificates.cert-manager.io" matches a specific custom resource "certificates.cert-manager.io"
  #  - "backendconfig" matches the singular name "backendconfig" in any group

  # Defaults to all custom resources
  custom_resource_tables = ["*"]

  # If no kubeconfig file can be found, the plugin will attempt to use the service account Kubernetes gives to pods.
  # This authentication method is intended for clients that expect to be running inside a pod running on Kubernetes.
}
```

- `config_context` - (Optional) The kubeconfig context to use. If not set, the current context will be used.
- `config_path` - (Optional) The kubeconfig file path. If not set, the plugin will check `~/.kube/config`. Can also be set with the `KUBE_CONFIG_PATHS` or `KUBERNETES_MASTER` environment variables.
- `custom_resource_tables` - (Optional) The custom resources to create as dynamic tables. If set to empty or not set, the plugin will not create any dynamic tables.

## Configuring Kubernetes Credentials

By default, the plugin will use the kubeconfig in `~/.kube/config` with the current context. If using the default kubectl CLI configurations, the kubeconfig will be in this location and the Kubernetes plugin connections will work by default.

You can also set the kubeconfig file path and context with the `config_path` and `config_context` config arguments respectively.

This plugin supports querying Kubernetes clusters using [OpenID Connect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) (OIDC) authentication. No extra configuration is required to query clusters using OIDC.

If no kubeconfig file is found, then the plugin will [attempt to access the API from within a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/access-api-from-pod/#accessing-the-api-from-within-a-pod) using the service account Kubernetes gives to pods.

## Custom Resource Definitions

Kubernetes also supports creating [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) with a name and schema that you specify in the `custom_resource_tables` configuration argument which allows you to extend Kubernetes capabilities by adding any kind of API object useful for your application.

For instance, given the CRD `certManager.yaml`:

And the custom resource `spCloudCertificate.yaml`:

```yml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: temporal-w-spcloud123456
  labels:
    workspace-id: w_spcloud123456
    identity-id: o_spcloud123456
    region: apse1
    shard: "0001"

  secretName: temporal-w-spcloud123456-tls
  duration: 87600h # 10 years
  dnsNames:

```

If my connection configuration is:

```hcl
connection "kubernetes" {
  plugin = "kubernetes"
  custom_resource_tables = ["certificates.*"]
}
```

Steampipe will automatically create the `kubernetes_certificate` table, which can then be inspected and queried like other tables:

```bash
.inspect kubernetes_certificate;
