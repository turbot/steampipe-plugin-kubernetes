# Table: kubernetes_namespace

Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.<br />

Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects. They provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces.

## Examples

### Basic Info
