# Table: {custom_resource_name.group_name}

Query data from the custom resource called `{custom_resource_name.group_name}`, e.g., `certificates.cert-manager.io`, `storeconfigs.crossplane.io`. A table is automatically created to represent each object in the `objects` argument.

For instance, given the CRD `certManager.yaml`:

```yml

And the custom resource `spCloudCertificate.yaml`:

```yml

  labels:
    workspace-id: w_spcloud123456

  secretName: temporal-w-spcloud123456-tls
  duration: 87600h # 10 years
  dnsNames:

This plugin will automatically create a table called `certificates.cert-manager.io`:

```
> select name, uid, kind, api_version, namespace from "certificates.cert-manager.io";

| name                               | uid                                  | kind        | api_version        | namespace |
